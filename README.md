### Cropped OHRC train-test datatset : [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arijitdas2002/tudumm) 

As we know that the problem statement is regarding enchancement of low resolution images(TMC dataset) to higher resolution, we used **SRResnet model**.

The srresnet.py file contains the code for the model of 21 layer deep network which we have used to train the images i.e from Low resolution to High Resolution images. We have trained the images and saved the weights of the model .

## Installation :

We used ***PDS4 Viewer*** for viewing large xml files. Following is the installation code in python for the same:

``` !pip install pds4_tools```


## Stacks Used
1. pds4_tools
2. skimage
3. torchmetrics
4. glob
5. tqdm
6. PIL
